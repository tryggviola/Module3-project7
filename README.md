## Intro

I chose to recreate a part of the website for Listasafn Reykjav√≠kur (https://listasafnreykjavikur.is/) First I wanted to create pages for the art exhibition but I ended up creating a landing page for the different museums.

## The Process

The process was really simple, I created the layout in <strong>Figma</strong> and all the pictures I cropped and masked in photoshop so there was no background on them for a cleaner look.

## The Journey

I really enjoyed using <strong>Figma</strong> and especially the prototyping part of it. I really went back and forth in this project but I really like the final product of it.

## Features and functions

If you click the play button in the top right corner you can see how the site is setup. Most of the links do not work but you can see the hover effects and how the menu burger expands. 

## The Conclusion

Working in Figma is really great and I like how simple it is to use, I cant wait to learn some more.
